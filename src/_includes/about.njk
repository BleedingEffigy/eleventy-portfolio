        <p><span class="is-size-1">I</span>'m someone who's had an interest in coding since I was a teenager, which helped me as I studied Computer Engineering at SBCC. Attending school helped me develop research and communication skills, but working with my hands on film sets and at warehouses has helped me develop work-ethic and practical skills, which I use to tackle my projects head-on.
<br><span class="is-size-1">T</span>oday my affinity for tech expresses itself in various ways: by putting projects on the cloud, trying out new designs on my websites, and building a project as a way to learn new tech. 
<br><span class="is-size-1">I</span> love to learn and hack, so let's talk!
